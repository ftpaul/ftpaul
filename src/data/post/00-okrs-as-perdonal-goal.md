title: "OKRs as personal goal method"
---

Some years ago, I was struggling with setting up goals for myself. I had some objectives in mind and planned them at the beginning of each year, but then I never looked to them again. Soon I would forget that they exist until I try again. It was also hard to commit to something big and hard to measure like "be more healthy" or "improve my communication skills."

It was until I started to read more about the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) and how some people used them as personal goal setting that I began to try them.

My transition to the way OKRs work was very smooth. It starts with an objective that can be more or less tangible and multiple key results that help me to understand what steps I need to give towards the defined objective. Here's an example: 

Objective: be more healthy
Key results:
 * Walk 10.000 steps every day
 * Go to the gym three times per week
 * Find a personal trainer 
 * Reduce body fat by 25%

On top of that, I set up my OKRs every quarter and make an effort to review the progress weekly or bi-weekly. It's essential to keep a close eye on them to understand where I stand at each moment and to learn from things that don't go well.

You can have the template of my spreadsheet that I use to track my personal OKRs.

Key takeaways:
OKRs can be a great tool for personal goal setting
Have a short timeline for them (less than one year)
Review them frequently
Learn and iterate from your mistakes
