In the second half of 2017, I was struggling with setting up goals for myself. I had some objectives in mind and planned them at the beginning of each year, but then — as it probably happens to you —, I never looked at them again. Soon, I would forget that they exist until I try to set them up again. It was also hard to commit to something big and hard to measure like "be more healthy" or "improve my communication skills."

One time, I started to read more about the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and [how some people used them as personal goal setting](https://medium.com/@cwodtke/personal-okrs-three-years-later-7616e60574a4). Hence, I decided to give it a shot.

My transition to the way OKRs work was very smooth. And so it will for you. 

It starts with **3 to 4 objectives** that can be more, or less tangible and **3 to 5 key results** per objective that help me to understand what steps I need to give towards the said objective. 

I plan and analyze my OKRs **per quarter**, since it's easier to project them for the next three months, than for a year or a longer period. Here's an example: 

**Objective**: be more healthy

**Key results**:
 * Walk 10,000 steps every day
 * Go to the gym three times per week
 * Hire a personal trainer 
 * Reduce body fat by 10%

On top of setting up my OKRs every quarter, I make an effort to **review the progress weekly or bi-weekly**. It's essential to keep a close eye on them to understand where I stand at each moment and to learn from things that are not progressing

Today, I’m glad to share a very straightforward spreadsheet template that I use to track my personal OKRs.


> ###Key takeaways:
>  * OKRs can be a great framework for personal goal setting
>  * Choose 2 to 4 objectives wisely
>  * Per each objective pick 3 to 5 measurable key results
>  * Have a short timeline for them (less than one year)
>  * Review them frequently
>  * Learn and iterate from your mistakes
