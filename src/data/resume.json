With his technical background, he has a great balance of people and technical skills. He leaves no loose ends and always strives to get everyone on the same page.  tl;dr: Paulo has been a great mentor and I would jump on an opportunity to work with him any time."

Organized, rigorous and detail oriented, Paulo plaid a key role in the decision making process of the strategy of the team. Smart and self learner Paulo challenges others and love being challenged which continuously drive the overall performance of the team to excellence.

Paulo was one of a kind with his always-ready-to-write notebook, unique spreadsheets, and productivity hacks. All of this combined with Paulo‚Äôs dedication to empowering the growth of others resulted in the implementation of key project management techniques in the team, especially later in his role as Web Properties Product Manager.    While many of us are still figuring out what does a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù mean, Paulo has proven to have a very clearly defined vision of his path as Product Manager; he was and he is continuously striving to achieve that in his daily tasks and personal connections.  Personally, I have to thank Paulo for his outstanding mentoring skills to guide me through my career advancement and for being my ‚Äúteacher assistant‚Äù on my journey towards becoming a web developer for the past year. I've also witnessed this mentorship approach happening when Paulo was onboarding new members to the team.  On top of his full-time job, Paulo never stops learning and not only he‚Äôs always involved in side gigs as a frontend developer, and there will also hardly be a day where Paulo won‚Äôt read for at least one hour to keep feeding his mind.   Finally, Paulo‚Äôs unique personality traits are a must in any team ‚Äî he‚Äôll keep challenging every manager to seek excellence while granting a more humane group of people working together."

Paulo adapts very fast to the changing conditions of the market, which often require last minute changes to on-going projects. These are never a problem but are seen as an opportunity to further improve our position. I am happy to recommend Paulo for any product management position particularly if it involves public facing assets."
